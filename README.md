# Eye Disease Diagnosis System

This repository contains an AI-powered system designed to diagnose eye diseases using medical images. Leveraging deep learning models, the system accurately classifies a range of eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma, and other common ocular diseases. The model is trained on large datasets of annotated eye images, providing reliable and fast diagnostic results.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Classifies eye diseases using advanced neural networks.
- **Conditions Supported**: Diagnoses common conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma, and more.
- **Real-Time Diagnostics**: Fast and accurate image classification for immediate results.
- **Integration Ready**: Can be easily integrated into healthcare applications.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Ocular Disease Recognition (ODIR-5K) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k) available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset by following the instructions on the Kaggle page.
